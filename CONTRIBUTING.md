I am a hardware engineer and no nothing about GitHub and such things (the only reason I signed up to GitHub is beacause I saw this project).  I am sure I am not meant to be writing this hear, but, well, I'm not sorry! I just want to say that this project is one of the most incridible & amazing projects in the world EVER! God bless you for taking this on.  MS DOS on a CBM 8Bit, does the the world get any more esotoric than this? I think not. Again, God bless you, just increadible what you are working on!  Oh, just delete this btw, I am sure I am not meant to be writing this here, as I already mentioned, I am a hardware engineer that knows nothing of GitHUb and such software-ish type things.  email: thestingray64@gmail.com
